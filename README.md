# gift-list-app
A gift list app using vanilla JS, AJAX, PHP, and MySQL.

Challenges:
- I started out following a Udemy course, but the instructor used jQuery and I wanted to challenge myself to use vanilla JS. Additionally, the instructor was including JS code in PHP files due to dynamically-loaded content, and I wanted to see if I could handle that in another way while keeping JS and PHP separate.
- I was initially having CORS issues. I did some research and learned that the CORS issues occur when opening a file in the browser from Finder, so to fix the issue I need to access the file path in the browser directly.
